# eLTER RI Workflows Diagrams

Based on the interaction with the Science Cases and the evaluation of the deliverables of the eLTER PLUS project have been identified a number of data related workflows. These encompass (a) the acquisition and access to historic and legacy data from eLTER facilities, (b) the access and extraction of relevant EO information, (c) the access and extraction of relevant third party data, (d) the prototyping of data products for eLTER, and (e) the provision of SO conformant data to the central eLTER facilities. All workflows are described following a basic schema and are modelled with a generic activity diagram (Belleflamme, A., Vereecken, H., Peterseil, J., Dirnböck, T., Haase, P., Sinclair, J., Orenstein, D., Dick, J., Bolton, W., Oggioni, A., Koivula, H., Gillespie, L., Gaube, V., Poppe, Ch., Zacharias, S., Diaz-Pines, E., Mallast, U., Marangi, C., Nikolaidis, N., Trembath, P., Villwock, H., Wohner, Ch., Musche, M., Bastos, R., Lomba, A., Vicente, J., Kobler, J., Offenthaler, I., Bertsch-Hörmann, B., Minic, V.

This report contais the diagrams of workflows as a implemented for D10.3. This repository has the dual purpose of being a place to store different versions of the diagrams, but also to distribute different versions of the diagrams so that changes can be remembered.
